    <h1 class="cursive w3-text-black">Why use BeSoMusical?</h1>
    <p>Private music lessons have existed for a while. However, teachers and students are still limited to using paper assignment books, and their only way to communicate outside of the lesson is through a parent. This leads to broken communication, and
        a one-week delay in the teacher helping the student. BeSoMusical solves this with an intuitive interface that works everywhere, even on your phone. Gone are the days of simple assignment books and a few cryptic emails exchanged through the parent.
        Say hello to streamlined, online, and modern communication to best coordinate lessons.
